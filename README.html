To setup an additional CLIP sensor:
POST the following to /api/<INSERT KEY>/sensors
{
  "state": {
    "status": 2
  },
  "config": {
    "on": true,
    "reachable": true
  },
  "name": "stateVardagsrum",
  "type": "CLIPGenericStatus",
  "modelid": "Custom Motion Sensor",
  "manufacturername": "Philips",
  "swversion": "1.0",
  "uniqueid": "13:37:42:00:00:0001",
  "recycle": true
}

Now get the API numbers of your presence sensor, daylight sensor,
CLIPGenericStatus sensor, and all the scenes you want to use.

Clone the repo and change all API numbers. Copy one rule at a time and POST to
/api/<INSERT KEY>/sensors
